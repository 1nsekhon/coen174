CHICKEN BENTO had weird pieces of chicken. Where was the teriyaki flavor, or sauce for that matter. Rice tasted old. CHICKEN & SHRIMP TERIYAKI had mushy noodles. And again, where is the teriyaki flavor? Veggies were mushy and tasted like they were from a frozen bag. Will never order from here again.

The salad was steam veggies. It was too mushy, like baby food. It didn't come with CA rolls. It came with two servings of pot stickers. The chicken was dry and lacked flavor. It was more like brunt chicken. I ate half of it and was done.

It's good for an last minute dinner, however, a little more sauce wouldn't hurt.
