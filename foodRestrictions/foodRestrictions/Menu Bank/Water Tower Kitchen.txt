Mexican Pizza is amazing! CRISPY through every bite. It traveled well too. The Turkey Club is oddly more delicious than what I've had anywhere else. Not sure why but it is. Everything is always really good here. Downtown Mac & Cheese of course is also delicious. I get mine without breadcrumbs and prefer it that way. Thank you for some solid delicious food.

The burger was pretty over cooked and very dry. The fries were also cold when they were delivered. The Downtown Mac & Cheese is pretty good though.

Extremely bland and dry. And didn't include all items as requested. Not worth it.

Fail proof. My favorites are the chicken strips, fried chicken sando, Mac and cheese, queso, and the Chinese chicken salad. Additionally, they package the items at risk of moisture in containers with vents so they don't get soggy! They do a wonderful job. Consistently. Thank you!
