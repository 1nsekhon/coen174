It's been a while since I had such great sushi for delivery. The best thing about this restaurant is "freshness" and "being moderate." The rice was great in temperature and flavor. The roll was great. I know now where to order sushi for delivery. Thank you so much.

The sushi overall was fine, and the fish was fresh, but the rolls were MASSIVE and had so much imitation crab inside that it was hard to eat and a bit overwhelming. The house salad was also larger than expected, and in my opinion, could be split by two people.

Awesome Roll, with fresh fish. The Nara roll and 2021 have become my favorite rolls. I really like how each roll is packaged in its own container. When packaged together sometimes there's not enough space for each roll.
