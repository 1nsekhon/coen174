• DoorDash Order
Ordered from here a ton of times, the "regular" upgrade is absolutely worth the extra food, but the small is a perfect portion. You cannot go wrong no matter what you order, everything here is bomb.

Ordered chicken & falafel platter. The order was missing pita and rice. Both falafel and chicken were very dry and felt overcooked.

• DoorDash Order
I placed an order for a regular size chicken platter and I did not ask for extra lettuce. My bowl had more lettuce in it than it had rice. About half of my bowl was just lettuce. I have eaten at Halal guys before and could never finish a regular size bowl at one sitting. However I was left hungry after this meal
