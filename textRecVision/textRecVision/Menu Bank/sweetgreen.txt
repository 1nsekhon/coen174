Why am I paying $8.00 for some cheap sweet potato skins that fill 1/4 of the container you send them in. At least give a full cup of sweet potatoes and not just dry skins squeezed together and a couple full chunks. They are a complete ripoff!!! I bought three orders to put together to make 1.5 cups of sweet potatoes. That's $24.00 plus tax and delivery. Think about it owner!!!!
