I've been a fan of Palmetto for years, but Ive been ordering much more recently and the flavors never let me down!! I do, however, take into consideration the melting factor in what I order based on how far I am from the location. So I wont order the pitaya knowing itll be liquid by the time it gets to me. Cinnamon oatmeal and chia pudding are my top 2!

Usually they are very good. But the order was incorrect - it had bananas instead of blueberries. And it was melted and runny by the time it arrived.
