Excellent! Ordered the Pancit, it was very flavorful and ready right away. I always compare to my Moms cooking and this was perfect! Thank you!

The rice they use is not good quality: the grains are too big, ends up sticky clumps. About 15% of the rice ends up mushy and pasty. Ugh. The entrees are good tho.
