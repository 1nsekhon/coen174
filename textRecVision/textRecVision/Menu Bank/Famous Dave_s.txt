Loved the rib tips and the corn bread, did not like the fries, Mac and cheese and ribs. The ribs were very tough, the mac and cheese had corn and was just kind of weird. The fries were also very weird, im not sure I can describe them adequately.

Nobody does ribs like Famous Daves. They are worth every penny that they charge. The ribs are always cooked to perfection. Wilbur's Beans and cornbread are yummy! Dave's Barbeque chicken is always delicious.

The St. Louis-Style ribs were good. I would've expected a bit more sauce - almost like a rub. Meat was tender. And you can taste the smokey flavor from it. It's worth getting this once in a blue moon as a treat, but it wouldn't be something I'd go for on a weekly basis.

I called the San Jose store to ask them to please send me ribs that were not blackened and dried out. For a second time in a row I was disappointed in the quality. I do not know what is happening at the San Jose store but they need to get a new pit master. Up until the last month, I could always count on receiving great ribs. They have one more time before they lose me as a long time customer.
