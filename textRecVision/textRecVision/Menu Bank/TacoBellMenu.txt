Great quick service and great food

• DoorDash Order
As always the food is great and cheap, and it's nice to have my favorite Breakfast Crunchwrap Sausage - but once again they sent me a Cinnabon coffee instead of black Premium Hot Coffee. Which is a problem for me as a lactose intolerant diabetic.

• DoorDash Order
Food was awesome as always, that familiar Taco Bell taste you have cravings for. The only markdown is the consistent replacing my black coffee with the Cinnabon coffee, which as someone with lactose intolerance I can't drink.

The ladies working made my order super fast. To top it off they were very kind and made sure I had everything I needed. 100% coming back to this location.
