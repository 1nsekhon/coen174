Amici's East Coast Pizzeria
PIZZAS
We bake our pizzas in brick ovens, the way tradition-minded Italians have been baking pizzas for hundreds of years. Because our pies are baked directly on the super-hot brick floor, the crust comes out crisp and darker than the typical American pizza – often a bit black. If you are a crust lover, you will find our crust distinctively delicious.
If a darker crust is not to your liking, please specify “light crust,” although the result may be under cooked for some tastes.
