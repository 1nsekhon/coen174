Great for a small / affordable but filling meal. - Miso soup was lovely - Tuna-Mayo tasted alright, but did not have enough filling - Salmon was by far my favorite - Mentaiko also didn't have much filling, but it was fine overall - Chicken Karaage is good but definitely not the best I've had, and is also pretty small portion For a meal I'd recommend no more than 2 rice balls, and perhaps an appetizer or two (miso soup / edamame would be my suggestions). Each rice ball contains 3 small pieces of Takuan, so keep that in mind if you are considering on ordering more P.S. rice balls.. unsurprisingly have a lot of rice and can be pretty filling.

This is so good, I ordered more daikon this time and it was worth it. I just like a piece of daikon with every bite. They give you 2 per onigiri, I would probably quadruple that myself - personal preference of course. Hope you can add more options onigiri options soon. Love this as a snack!

I'm so happy this exists, the salmon and tuna onigiri were my favorite snacks in Hawaii. It's simple and delicious.
