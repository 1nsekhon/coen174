I like a few different dishes. The fish burger, the Talapia over rice plate and the spicy chicken over rice are all so good. Yum, yum!

The fries and burgers were very poorly packaged, turned very soggy on delivery. The spice level was good but the zinger chicken was overdone and rubbery. Liked their kababs before but this order was not on par!

Baqlava was sooo good. Flaky and sweet without being overwhelmingly rich. Kebabs were also tasty.
