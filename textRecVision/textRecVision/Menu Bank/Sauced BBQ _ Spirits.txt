The Best BBQ in the area that I've tried all meats cooked to perfect, fresh and moist. Oh the sweet potato casserole is delicious. For the $ you spend portion size is awesome. Well they have managed to keep going back more........

EVERYTHING WAS DELICOUS! I was worried about the prices but it was so worth it! If you liked Armadillo Willys (and upset that they are gone) this place is worth it! I got the, Cheezy Cornbread Fritters, Glazed Brussel Sprouts, Fried Pickles & Peppers, Fried Oreos, 3 Meat Combo and Banana Puddin. There is two of us eating and there is enough food for like 4 people!

Foods so good but the brisket was almost more fat than meat on a few slices. Sides are all really good. Recommend the Brussel sprouts as well.
