The GOTO/RICE PORRIDGE#LARGE is very good on cloudy days or any day. A comfort food. DINUGUAN#LARGE is also delicious and doesn't feel heavy , so small portions can make it last. Since I don't have this all the time. TORTA TALONG is alright, but I prefer flat like pancake when it's made so it doesn't taste so much eggplant.

Always satisfies my Filipino food cravings. Pricier than some Fil restos but if you're looking for home cook tasting meals I highly recommend you visit Gabrielle's. Good value. Not to mention their nice and accomodating staffs, truly a plus :)

I love their bopis, puso ng saging and dinakdakan! My husband loves the BBQ chicken, and foods are packed neatly. Their servings are also very reasonable with the price.

Super expensive porridge for an incredibly small amount. Expected a large bowl for the size and this was provided in a small cup. Wanted to support Fil-Am stores, but prices are unreasonable .
