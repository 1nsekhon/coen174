# This is Khushboo Gupta, Will Olson, Nanki Sekhon, and Megan Wiser's project for COEN174.

We are working on a Dietary Restriction Helper iOS application

**REPOSITORY SETUP**
main - empty at the moment
Vision - SwiftUI code for an iOS app that takes a photo upload input and scans text from there
xcode-megan - SwiftUI code for an iOS app that uses the user camera to scan text in real time and display that text to the screen
backend - Python script that feeds chatGPT a query and results in a data frame

**PRODUCT VISION STATEMENT**
FOR: People who have dietary restrictions
WHO: Want a streamlined method to find safe foods
THE: Allergen Detector is a mobile software service
THAT: Scans menus and tells the user what their best options are to eat
UNLIKE: Bloggers, Monash University or gluten detectors
OUR PRODUCT: does the work of consolidating information before you order your food, providing a starting place for people to order from
